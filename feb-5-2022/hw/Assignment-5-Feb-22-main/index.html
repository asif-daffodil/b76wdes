        <p>The flag of Germany (German: Flagge Deutschlands) is a tricolor consisting of three equal horizontal bands
            displaying the national colors of Germany: black, red, and gold (German: Schwarz-Rot-Gold). The flag was
            first sighted in 1848 in the German Confederation; with it being officially adopted as the national flag of
            the Weimar Republic from 1919 to 1933, and again being in use since its reintroduction in West Germany in
            1949.</p>
        <p>Since the mid-19th century, Germany has had two competing traditions of national colors, black-red-gold and
            black-white-red. Black-red-gold were the colors of the 1848 Revolutions, the Weimar Republic of 1919-1933,
            and the Federal Republic (since 1949). They were also adopted by the German Democratic Republic (1949-1990).
        </p>
        <p>The colors black-white-red appeared for the first time in 1867, in the constitution of the North German
            Confederation. This nation-state for Prussia and other north and central German states was expanded to the
            south German states in 1870-71, under the name German Empire. It kept these colors until the revolution of
            1918-19. Thereafter, black-white-red became a symbol of the political right. The national socialists (Nazi
            Party) re-established these colors along with the party's own swastika flag in 1933. After World War II,
            black-white-red was still used by some conservative groups or by groups of the far right as it is not
            forbidden, unlike proper Nazi symbols.</p>
        <p>Black-red-gold is the official flag of the Federal Republic of Germany. As an official symbol of the
            constitutional order, it is protected against defamation. According to ยง90 of the German penal code, the
            consequences are a fine or imprisonment up to five years.</p>
